# Running the WHIZARD event generator

`WHIZARD` is a matrix element generator that is and has been extensively used for 
linear collider physics studies.

For more information, documentation and more advanced tutorials see the `WHIZARD`-homepage at:
[https://whizard.hepforge.org](https://whizard.hepforge.org).

In this tutorial we will show you a very simple example for how to run `Whizard` to generate some
events for the process $e^+e^- \rightarrow ZH$ with $Z\rightarrow \mu^+ \mu^-$.
