# Brief Introduction to Key4hep Tools

Key4hep is the software ecosystem for future (and current) HEP experiments.
In the following we will very briefly describe the main tools at the core of Key4hep.

Key4hep aims at creating a software ecosystem integrating in an optimal way the best software components to provide a ready-to-use full-fledged solution for data processing of HEP experiments (with initial focus on future colliders).
Using tools developed and used in HEP and ensuring interoperability:

Key4hep is used and developed by the community and combines the software stacks of most of the contributing experiments:

iLCSoft is a subset of Key4hep. It has been developed for two decades by the linear collider community and many tools and algorithms will still be needed in Key4hep.

For the linear collider community we are in a transition period where we gradualy replace the LCIO EDM with EDM4hep and the Marlin processing framework with Gaudi:
